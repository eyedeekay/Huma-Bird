This extension provides a helper which adds a simple UI for configuring an
I2P Mail account within Thunderbird. It fills in the settings required by
Postman's email service automatically, so the user only needs to enter their
own username and password.

It doesn't work yet but it's about 50% of the way there. The other 50% is going
to require a MailExtensions "Experiment" I'm pretty sure, which NGL I would like
to not do. So it's probably going to take a while. You'll have to do manual
config for now.
